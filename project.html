                                PDB_GTGT is the result of a novel research conducted at the SQLab towards benchmarking in the field of design pattern detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark which uses automatic generation of testbeds for the evaluation process. PDB_GTGT has a precise, and repeatable evaluation process, and can be used to compare pattern detection methods in an objective and fair fashion. In this benchmark, a detection method is evaluated based on its ability to mine different types of patterns (and their variants) from testbeds with different levels of complexity. PDB_GTGT meets the desiderata for benchmarks. It is fair, expandable, accessible, cost-effective, solvable, portable, and scalable.

                                In this project, using String Template Engine, we have implemented a tool for the automatic generation of Java source codes and their corresponding class diagrams. The generated codes vary in their levels of complexity and various types of design patterns are inserted in different locations of them.

                                Bad smells (anti-patterns) are bad practices in the design and implementation of a software system. These bad solutions significantly affect the maintainability and understandability of source code. Therefore, detection of bad smells plays an important role in the refactoring, and maintaining of large and complex software systems. However, issues such as informal specifications of bad smells and high false positive rates in the detection process complicate the detection process. In this project, we have developed and implemented a new method to detect bad smells in code by addressing the aforementioned issues.

                                In this project, we have developed and implemented a new design pattern detection method based on the graph theory. The proposed detection process is subdivided into two sequential phases. In the first phase, we concern both the semantics and the syntax of the structural signature of patterns. To do so, the system under study and the patterns asked to be detected, are transformed into semantic graphs. Now, the initial problem is converted into the problem of finding matches in the system graph for the pattern graph. To reduce the exploration space, based on a predetermined set of criteria, the system graph is broken into the possible subsystem graphs. After applying a semantic matching algorithm and obtaining the candidate instances, by analyzing the behavioral signature of the patterns, in the second phase, final matches will be obtained.

                                The diabetic retina is a serious and common complication of long-term diabetes in individuals. This complication can damage the retina and ultimately lead to blindness. Since, the emergence of red lesions (microaneurysms) on the retina is one of the first symptoms of a diabetic retina, extensive research has been done on the effective detection of these abnormalities. In this project, we have implemented a method based on the multi-scale correlation filtering and dynamic thresholding. This method involves two steps: (1) detection of candidate red lesions, and (2) precise detection of red lesions. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on ROC dataset.

                                Diabetic retinopathy, caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina, is a common complication of diabetes. This disease results in blurred or distorted vision and is one of the main causes of blindness in the world. Exudate is one of the early symptoms of diabetic retinopathy. Ophthalmologists require dilation of pupil's eye to detect exudates. Dilation of pupil, which is performed using a chemical solution, is a painful act and consumes lot of time. In this project, based on morphological operations, we have detected exudates from fundus images in the STARE bank automatically.

                                Optical character recognition (OCR) is the process of recognizing characters automatically in images and converting them into texts in a way that they can be searched and edited by a computer. An OCR system consists of several parts. First, the input image should be analyzed and modified if it’s text is rotated. After correcting the rotation, the position of the text, figure, and table blocks should be specified in the image. After determining the position of these kind of blocks (analyzing the document structure), the text blocks must be recognized; i.e. the text lines are found, and then the position of the words is determined, and in the next step, the position of the letters will be specified in the word. In this project, we have implemented an OCR system to identify Persian digits. For this purpose, we have used torque constants and a Fourier descriptor model for the extraction of the features.
