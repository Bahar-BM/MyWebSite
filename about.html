                    <p>
                        I am a recent Ph.D. graduate in Software Engineering. During my Ph.D. studies, I managed to get 4 years of experience in the area of Software Development and Software Quality Engineering. During the last 7 years with my academic work, I have gained valuable experience in programming, problem solving, team work, and researching. So, I believe that my Ph.D. was not such a waste of time after all. Hence, I might even be well suited for a job in industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have had the opportunity to complete several <a href="project.html">projects</a> and publish several <a href="publications.html">academic papers</a> in reputable journals. I have received multiple <a href="honors.html">awards</a>. For example, last year, I was awarded by Iranâ€™s National Elite Foundation for my achievements during my Ph.D.

                        I pride myself on my ability to face challenges head on. I examine different options and seek the opinion of my peers and superiors, before I decide on a solution. An example of this is a project I have recently completed during my Ph.D. In that project I led a group of graduate and undergraduate students. The budget was cut midway through the project; however, I was able to complete the project on time and slightly under the new budget. I did this by re-evaluating the project properties, re-negotiating with my team members and eliminating some costly enhancements that were mostly cosmetic and were not the main priority of the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe my experience and training during my academic period have prepared me to take the next step and pursue a new position in industry.
