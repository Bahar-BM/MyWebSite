                            <p>

                                Mining patterns is one of the most attractive topics in the field of software design. Knowledge about the number, type, and location of pattern instances is crucial to understand the original design decisions. Several techniques and tools have been presented in the literature for mining patterns in a software system. However, evaluating the quality of the detection results is usually done manually or subjectively. Therefore, the evaluation results can be significantly affected. As a result, a fair comparison of the quality of the various mining methods is not possible. In this paper, a new benchmark is developed to evaluate the pattern mining methods in the source code or design. Testbeds that are automatically generated in the presented benchmark are codes and their corresponding class diagrams with varying levels of complexity in which various types of patterns and their variants being inserted in different locations. In these testbeds, full information is available on the utilized patterns. Therefore, we are able to evaluate the pattern mining methods quantitatively and objectively. Also, the proposed benchmark can be used to compare pattern mining methods in a fair and repeatable manner.

                                Design patterns are strategies for solving commonly occurring problems within a given context in software design. In the process of re-engineering, detection of design pattern instances from source codes can play a major role in understanding large and complex software systems. However, detecting design pattern instances is not always a straightforward task. In this paper, based on the graph theory, a new design pattern detection method is presented. The proposed detection process is subdivided into two sequential phases. In the first phase, we concern both the semantics and the syntax of the structural signature of patterns. To do so, the system under study and the patterns asked to be detected, are transformed into semantic graphs. Now, the initial problem is converted into the problem of finding matches in the system graph for the pattern graph. To reduce the exploration space, based on a predetermined set of criteria, the system graph is broken into the possible subsystem graphs. After applying a semantic matching algorithm and obtaining the candidate instances, by analyzing the behavioral signature of the patterns, in the second phase, final matches will be obtained. The performance of the suggested technique is evaluated on three open source systems regarding precision and recall metrics. The results demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.

                                Design patterns are widely used by software developers to build complex systems. Hence, they have been investigated by many researchers in recent decades. This leads to the emergence of various topics in the design patterns field. The objective of this paper is to present an overview of the research efforts on design patterns for those researchers who seek to enter this area. The main contributions are as follows: (a) identifying research topics in design patterns, (b) quantifying the research emphasis on each topic, and (c) describing the demographics of design patterns research.

                                The objective of this paper is to study this concept of edge-tenacity and determining this quantity for some special classes of graphs. We calculate the first-order edge-tenacity of a complete n-partite graph. Moreover, the first-order edge-tenacity of maximal planar graphs, maximal outerplanar graphs, and k-trees is obtained.

                                The main goal of reusing software components is to produce new software systems using existing components rather than building them from scratch. Component-based software development is one of the most common approaches found today in different branches of engineering. However, reusing components in software engineering is still faced with numerous challenges. In order to increase efficiency and accelerate the adoption of component reuse in software development, quantitative measurement of components reusability is necessary. In this regard, various models and metrics have been proposed, so it is important to review the research literature on this concept fairly and comprehensively. In this paper, we conducted a systematic review to identify and evaluate the methods that have been used for measuring components reusability and provide a new classification. Finally, based on the results of studies carried out, some of the relating challenges and issues have been introduced.

                                Numerous networks as, for example, road networks, electrical networks and communication networks can be modeled by a graph. Many attempts have been made to determine how well such A network is "connected" or stated differently how much effort is required to break down communication in the system between at least some nodes. Two well-known measures that indicate how "reliable" a graph is are the "Tenacity" and "Edge-tenacity" of a graph. The objective of this paper is to study the generalized concept of edge-tenacity and determining this quantity for complete n-partite graphs.
